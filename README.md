# 🐼 Pandas Learning Journey

Welcome to my Pandas learning repository! This repo contains practical notebooks, mini-projects, and exercises as I explore and master the **Pandas library** for data analysis in Python.

---

## 📌 About Pandas

**Pandas** is a powerful open-source data analysis and data manipulation library for Python. It provides high-level data structures like:
- `Series` – one-dimensional labeled arrays
- `DataFrame` – two-dimensional labeled data tables

## 📚 Topics Covered

Here’s a structured list of topics I’m learning and practicing:

### 🔹 Basics
- Introduction to Series and DataFrames
- Creating and loading data (`read_csv`, `read_excel`)
- Indexing, slicing, and selection (`loc`, `iloc`)

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values (`isnull`, `dropna`, `fillna`)
- Data type conversions
- Renaming and replacing

### 🔹 Data Analysis
- Filtering and sorting
- Merging, joining, and concatenation

### 🔹 Data Visualization (with Pandas + Matplotlib)
- Plotting bar charts, histograms, and line plots
- Customizing plots

### 🔹 Real-World Projects (Coming Soon)
- Mini-projects using public datasets
- End-to-end data analysis case studies

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this learning journey, I aim to:

✅ Be confident in using Pandas for real-world data analysis  
✅ Build a strong foundation in data wrangling and preprocessing  
✅ Apply Pandas in ML & Data Science projects
